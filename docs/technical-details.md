# Technical Details

This document provides an in-depth look at how the Contact Form 7 to HubSpot Integration plugin works internally.

## Architecture Overview

The plugin follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Main Plugin File** (`cf7-hubspot-integration.php`) - Initializes the plugin and sets up hooks
2. **Form Handler** (`includes/class-cf7-hubspot-form-handler.php`) - Processes form submissions and coordinates the sync process
3. **API Client** (`includes/class-cf7-hubspot-api-client.php`) - Handles communication with the HubSpot API
4. **Data Mapper** (`includes/class-cf7-hubspot-data-mapper.php`) - Maps form fields to HubSpot properties
5. **Settings Manager** (`includes/class-cf7-hubspot-settings.php`) - Manages plugin configuration
6. **Logger** (`includes/class-cf7-hubspot-logger.php`) - Handles logging for debugging and monitoring
7. **Activation/Deactivation** (`includes/class-cf7-hubspot-activator.php`, `includes/class-cf7-hubspot-deactivator.php`) - Plugin lifecycle management

## Core Components

### 1. Main Plugin File

The main plugin file initializes the plugin and registers all necessary hooks. It sets up the admin menu, loads the required classes, and ensures that the plugin is properly integrated with Contact Form 7.

Key responsibilities:
- Registering activation and deactivation hooks
- Setting up admin pages
- Loading required classes
- Hooking into Contact Form 7 submission process

### 2. Form Handler

The `CF7_HubSpot_Form_Handler` class is the core of the plugin's functionality. It:
- Hooks into the `wpcf7_submit` action to intercept form submissions
- Validates that the form is configured for HubSpot integration
- Maps form data to HubSpot properties
- Coordinates the sending of data to the HubSpot API
- Handles errors and logs the process

### 3. API Client

The `CF7_HubSpot_API_Client` handles all communication with the HubSpot API:
- Makes HTTP requests to HubSpot endpoints
- Authenticates with the HubSpot API using Bearer tokens
- Handles API responses and errors
- Implements retry logic for transient failures

### 4. Data Mapper

The `CF7_HubSpot_Data_Mapper` class handles mapping form fields to HubSpot properties:
- Processes the `[hubspot-mapping]` shortcode
- Maps form field values to HubSpot contact properties
- Supports both standard and custom HubSpot properties
- Validates that required properties are mapped

### 5. Settings Manager

The `CF7_HubSpot_Settings` class manages the plugin configuration:
- Provides the admin UI for entering HubSpot API credentials
- Validates and saves configuration settings
- Ensures that API keys are stored securely

### 6. Logger

The `CF7_HubSpot_Logger` class handles all logging activities:
- Logs successful integrations
- Records errors and exceptions
- Provides debugging information for troubleshooting
- Supports log file rotation to prevent disk space issues

## Data Flow

1. **Form Submission**: A user submits a Contact Form 7 form
2. **Hook Interception**: The plugin intercepts the submission via the `wpcf7_submit` hook
3. **Validation**: Checks if the form is configured for HubSpot integration
4. **Field Mapping**: Maps form fields to HubSpot properties using the data mapper
5. **API Communication**: Sends the mapped data to the HubSpot API using the API client
6. **Response Handling**: Processes the API response and logs the result
7. **Error Management**: Handles any errors that occur during the process

## Security Considerations

### API Credential Storage

API credentials are stored in WordPress options with proper sanitization and validation. The plugin:
- Uses WordPress security best practices for storing sensitive data
- Does not store credentials in plain text in the database
- Implements proper input validation and sanitization

### Input Validation

All form data is validated before being sent to HubSpot:
- Required fields are checked
- Email addresses are validated
- Data types are verified
- Malicious input is sanitized

## Error Handling

The plugin implements comprehensive error handling:
- All API calls are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Detailed error messages are logged for debugging
- Users are notified of errors in the WordPress admin
- Retry logic is implemented for transient failures

## Logging Mechanism

The plugin maintains detailed logs of all HubSpot interactions:
- Successful submissions
- API errors
- Configuration issues
- Processing warnings

Logs are stored in the WordPress debug log file and can be accessed through the WordPress admin interface.

## Plugin Lifecycle

### Activation

On plugin activation, the following occurs:
- Creates necessary database tables (if any)
- Sets default configuration values
- Registers cron jobs (if needed)
- Ensures proper permissions are set

### Deactivation

On plugin deactivation:
- Cleans up temporary data
- Removes any scheduled cron jobs
- Preserves configuration settings

## Extensibility

The plugin is designed to be extensible:
- Hooks are provided for custom functionality
- Classes are structured for inheritance
- Configuration options allow for customization
